# CHIP 8 Emulator in TypeScript

This is my first attempt at writing an emulator for an arbitrary computer architecture (even if it never existed). Chip-8 was designed back in—what I assume to be—the 1970s. I figured that I'd give it a shot at emulating it, as a way to test the waters of emulating computers.

The CPU and the UI is written in TypeScript, and React is used as the UI management framework.

## Building and Running

You'll only need to install Node.js.

- From this project's root, run `npm i` (installs dependencies)
- Run `./node_modules/.bin/tsc` (compiles the TypeScript code)
- Install any web server. I like to use nws. To install it, run the command `npm i -g nws`
